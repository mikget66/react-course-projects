# Steps

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates the usage of state and event handling in React components.

## Learning Objectives

The main learning objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Understanding React state: The project showcases the usage of React's `useState` hook to manage state within a functional component. It demonstrates how to define and update state variables using the `useState` hook.

2. Event handling in React: The project illustrates how to handle events, such as button clicks, in React components. It showcases the usage of event handlers and how to update the state based on user interactions.

3. Conditional rendering: The project demonstrates how to conditionally render elements in React based on the state. It shows how to use conditional statements and expressions to show or hide components dynamically.

4. JSX and component structure: The project provides an example of how to structure a React component using JSX syntax. It shows how to define components, use props, and compose multiple components together.
