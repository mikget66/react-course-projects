# usepopcorn

## Description

usepopcorn is a project that aims to demonstrate various concepts in React development, including effects, custom hooks, data fetching, component composition, props, and PropTypes. This project serves as a learning resource to help developers understand and practice these concepts in a practical setting.

## Learning Objectives

The main learning objectives of the usepopcorn project are:

1. **Effects**: Gain an understanding of how to use effects in React components to perform side effects such as data fetching, event listeners, or DOM manipulations.

2. **Custom Hooks**: Learn how to create custom hooks to encapsulate reusable logic and share it across multiple components.

3. **Data Fetching**: Explore different techniques for fetching data in React, such as using built-in APIs like `fetch` or third-party libraries like Axios.

4. **Component Composition**: Understand the concept of component composition and how to create reusable and composable components.

5. **Props**: Learn how to pass data and behavior to child components using props and how to handle them in the receiving component.

6. **PropTypes**: Gain familiarity with PropTypes, a library used for type-checking the props passed to components, ensuring that the correct types are provided.

## Installation

To run the usepopcorn project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mikget66/react-course-projects/tree/main/05-usepopcorn.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd usepopcorn
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```



5. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the project running.

## Project Structure

The project structure of usepopcorn is as follows:

```
usepopcorn/
  |- public/
  |  |- index.html
  |- src/
  |  |- components/
  |  |  |- ...
  |  |- hooks/
  |  |  |- ...
  |  |- App.js
  |  |- index.js
  |  |- ...
  |- package.json
  |- ...
```

- The `public` directory contains the index.html file, which serves as the entry point for the React application.

- The `src` directory is where most of the project code resides.

  - The `components` directory holds reusable React components used throughout the application.

  - The `hooks` directory contains custom hooks created for encapsulating and reusing logic.

  - The `App.js` file is the root component of the application.

  - The `index.js` file is the entry point for React, where the ReactDOM renders the `App` component into the DOM.

- The `package.json` file lists the project's dependencies and scripts.

## Usage

Once you have the usepopcorn project running locally, you can explore the different features and concepts it showcases. The project is designed to provide examples and demonstrations of the learning objectives mentioned earlier.

Feel free to navigate through the codebase, examine the components, hooks, and utilities, and modify them to experiment and deepen your understanding of React development.
